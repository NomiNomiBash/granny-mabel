# ðŸ§“ðŸ¥« Granny Mabel vs the World

Granny Mabel vs the World is an experimental narrative sandbox game that explores the deep and often invisible links between global economic policy and everyday life. Players shift between the intimate, hand-painted world of Grandma Mabelâ€™s seaside food stand and a cold, abstract realm of global trade decisions. What happens in the tariff chamber echoes in Mabelâ€™s worldâ€”one recipe, one relationship, one ripple at a time.

â€¢	Grandma Mabelâ€™s Shore
A cozy life sim where players cook and serve regulars in a small coastal town. Ingredient availability and community moods subtly shift based on global policy.

**🧓🥫 Granny Mabel vs the World**

**Granny Mabel vs the World** is an experimental narrative sandbox game that explores the deep and often invisible links between global economic policy and everyday life. Players shift between the intimate, hand-painted world of Grandma Mabel's seaside food stand and a cold, abstract realm of global trade decisions. What happens in the tariff chamber echoes in Mabel's world—one recipe, one relationship, one ripple at a time.

**🧮 The Tariff Chamber**
